submit a revised version of our code which compiles and runs to provide a working version of the game connectn, allowing 1 human player to play 2 computer players.
we recommend you first get a game of connect4 working for one human and one computer player.
you may wish (but are not obliged) to start by commenting out large parts of our code and altering our printboard() method. this approach has the advantage of giving you a relatively manageable starting point in the debugging process.
you may also wish to tackle our placecounter() method next.
once you have a working game of connect4 for two players, extend your code to work for 3 players (1 human vs. 2 computer players) in a game of connectn, where 2 < n < 7. this code will be what you need to submit.
